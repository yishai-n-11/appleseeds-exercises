**Scenario: Collaborative Story Writing**

**Steps:**
1. **Repository Setup:**
   - Set up a shared GitHub repository for the project.
   - Each student should clone the repository to their local machine using Git.

2. **Collaborative Story Writing:**
   - Each student creates a new text file named after themselves (e.g., `student_name.txt`) in the repository.
   - In their text file, they write a paragraph of a story. This paragraph can be creative and imaginative.
   - They commit and push their text file to the repository.

3. **Generating Merge Conflict:**
   - After a few students have committed their paragraphs, select a point in the repository's history.
   - Two students should both attempt to modify the same text file at this point, adding additional content to the same paragraph.

4. **Attempt to Merge:**
   - Both students commit and push their changes to the repository.
   - One student creates a pull request to merge their changes into the main project branch.
   - The other student does the same.

5. **Merge Conflict Occurrence:**
   - When the second pull request is submitted, a merge conflict occurs because both students modified the same part of the text file.

6. **Conflict Resolution:**
   - Guide the students on resolving the conflict:
     - Each student needs to pull the latest changes from the main project branch to their local repository.
     - They need to open the conflicted file and identify the conflicting parts (the overlapping paragraph).
     - They decide how to merge the conflicting paragraphs or choose one version over the other.
     - After editing the file, they commit the changes and push them to the repository.

7. **Finalizing the Story:**
   - Once the merge conflict is resolved, continue the collaborative story writing by having each student add another paragraph to their respective text files.
   - Encourage creativity and continuity in the story.

8. **Story Compilation:**
   - When all students have contributed additional paragraphs, compile the individual text files into a single story text file.

9. **Reflection and Discussion:**
   - After completing the project, have a discussion about the merge conflict experience.
   - Discuss the importance of communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution in a collaborative development environment.

This scenario allows your students to practice basic BASH commands for creating and editing text files, Git version control for collaborative writing, and resolving merge conflicts. It also encourages creativity and collaboration in a fun and engaging way.
